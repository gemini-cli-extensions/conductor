# Command Syntax Matrix (Baseline)

This matrix documents the observed or documented command syntax per tool and the artifact type each tool consumes. Items marked "needs confirmation" should be validated during implementation.

| Tool | Artifact Type | Example Command Style | Source/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gemini CLI | `commands/conductor/*.toml` + `gemini-extension.json` (context: `GEMINI.md`) | `/conductor:setup` | Slash + colon syntax referenced in `conductor/product.md` and command TOML prompts. |
| Qwen CLI | `commands/conductor/*.toml` + `qwen-extension.json` (context: `GEMINI.md`) | `/conductor:setup` | Same extension format as Gemini; needs confirmation in Qwen CLI docs. |
| Claude Code (plugin) | `.claude-plugin/*` + `.claude/commands/*.md` | `/conductor-setup` | Slash + dash syntax referenced in `skills/conductor/SKILL.md` and `.claude/README.md`. |
| Claude Code (Agent Skills) | `~/.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` (generated) | `/conductor-setup` | Slash + dash syntax in `skills/conductor/SKILL.md`; auto-activation for project context. |
| Codex CLI (Agent Skills) | `~/.codex/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` (generated) | `$conductor-setup` (needs confirmation) | Command style not documented in repo; user requirement mentions `$` for Codex. |
| OpenCode (Agent Skills) | `~/.opencode/skill/<skill>/SKILL.md` (generated) | `/conductor-setup` (needs confirmation) | Not documented in repo; likely slash-based but unverified. |
| Antigravity (local) | `.antigravity/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` (generated) | `@conductor /setup` (needs confirmation) | `conductor/product.md` notes IDE syntax like `@conductor /newTrack`. |
| Antigravity (global workflows) | `~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows/<skill>.md` (flat) | `@conductor /setup` (needs confirmation) | Generated by `scripts/sync_skills.py` with flat MD. |
| VS Code extension package | `conductor-vscode/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` (generated) | `@conductor /setup` (needs confirmation) | Same IDE chat pattern referenced in `conductor/product.md`. |
| GitHub Copilot Chat | `~/.config/github-copilot/conductor.md` (generated) | `/conductor-setup` | `scripts/sync_skills.py` emits `## Command: /conductor-setup` entries. |

## Notes
- Exact command styles should be verified against each tool's official docs or runtime behavior.
- The repo currently contains multiple prompt sources (`commands/`, `.claude/commands/`, templates), which may not be consistently generated from a single source.
