# Track Spec: Review and Robustness

## Overview
Following the extraction of `conductor-core`, this track focuses on auditing the new architecture for design flaws, missing test coverage, and opportunities for better abstraction. The goal is to mature the codebase from a "functional extraction" to a "robust platform foundation."

## Objectives
1.  **Codebase Audit:** Use the `codebase_investigator` to analyze the current structure of `conductor-core`, `conductor-gemini`, and the new `conductor-vscode` scaffolding.
2.  **Gap Analysis:** Identify missing tests, weak abstractions, or tight coupling that persisted after the initial extraction.
3.  **Refactoring:** Address identified issues to improve code quality and maintainability.
4.  **Integration Robustness:** Verify that the "Single Source of Truth" strategy for prompts is resilient and extensible.
5.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
    *   **Qwen CLI:** Create `qwen-extension.json` to ensure direct installability.
    *   **VS Code / Antigravity:** Configure `extensionKind` in `package.json` to support Remote Development workspaces (SSH/Codespaces/Antigravity) where the extension must run on the backend to access Git.

## Deliverables
-   Audit Report (generated by `codebase_investigator`).
-   Refactored `conductor-core` with improved type safety and error handling.
-   Enhanced test suite covering edge cases in git operations and prompt rendering.
-   **Qwen Code Configuration:** `qwen-extension.json` artifact.
-   **VS Code Configuration:** `package.json` updated for remote workspace support.
-   **Maturity Artifacts:** Updated README/ADRs, LSP feasibility report, and E2E smoke tests.
