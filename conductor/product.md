# Product Guide: Conductor Extension for Gemini CLI

## 1. Introduction

Conductor is a Gemini CLI extension that enables **Context-Driven Development**. It transforms the Gemini CLI into a proactive project manager that follows a strict protocol to specify, plan, and implement software features and bug fixes. The core philosophy is to manage context as a first-class artifact alongside code, creating a single source of truth that drives all development activities.

## 2. Target Audience

Conductor is designed for:

*   **Software Developers & Engineers:** Who want to leverage AI for coding with a structured, repeatable, and context-aware workflow.
*   **Project Managers & Team Leads:** Who need to ensure consistency, enforce standards, and maintain a high-level overview of development progress across their teams.

## 3. Core Problem & Solution

**Problem:** AI-driven code generation often lacks project-specific context, leading to inconsistent code, deviation from architectural patterns, and a disconnect between high-level requirements and implementation. Developers spend significant time re-establishing context for the AI in each session.

**Solution:** Conductor solves this by creating a persistent, version-controlled context for the project. It formalizes the development process into discrete, manageable "tracks" (features or bugs), each with its own specification and plan. This ensures that every line of code generated by the AI is aligned with the project's goals, technical stack, and style guides.

## 4. Key Features

*   **Guided Project Scaffolding (`/conductor:setup`):** Interactively sets up the project's foundational context, including product goals, tech stack, and development workflows.
*   **Structured Task Management (`/conductor:newTrack`):** Creates a new "track" for a feature or bug, generating a detailed specification (`spec.md`) and an actionable implementation plan (`plan.md`).
*   **Context-Aware Implementation (`/conductor:implement`):** Executes the plan task-by-task, ensuring the AI adheres to the established context and workflow (e.g., TDD).
*   **Progress Monitoring (`/conductor:status`):** Provides a high-level overview of all active and completed tracks.
*   **Safe Reversion (`/conductor:revert`):** A git-aware revert command that can undo work at the track, phase, or task level, providing more granular control than standard git commands.
*   **Team-Wide Consistency:** Establishes a shared foundation for product goals, tech stack, and workflow preferences that can be used by anyone on the team.

## 5. Future Roadmap

*   **Cross-Platform Support:** While currently a Gemini CLI extension, the long-term vision is to bring Conductor's context-driven methodology to other platforms.
*   **GitHub Copilot Integration:** Extend Conductor's features to work with GitHub Copilot, providing a unified and context-aware development experience across different AI coding assistants.
