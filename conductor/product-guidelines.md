# Product Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for prose style, brand messaging, and visual identity for projects managed by Conductor.

## 1. Prose Style

All documentation, user-facing messages, and in-code comments should adhere to the following principles:

*   **Clarity:** Use simple and unambiguous language. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it clearly if necessary.
*   **Conciseness:** Get to the point. Avoid unnecessary words and filler content.
*   **Directness:** Focus on providing actionable information. Tell users what they need to know and what they need to do.

## 2. Brand Messaging

Our brand messaging should be user-centric and supportive. The primary goal is to empower users and make their experience as smooth as possible.

*   **Tone:** The tone should be helpful, encouraging, and respectful.
*   **Focus:** Communications should emphasize ease of use, the benefits to the user, and our commitment to supporting them.
*   **Empowerment:** Frame messages in a way that gives users confidence and control.

## 3. Visual Identity

At this time, there are no project-wide visual identity guidelines. Visual identity, including logos, color schemes, and typography, will be defined on a per-project basis to best suit the needs of each individual project.
