# Tech Stack

This document outlines the core technology stack for the Conductor extension itself.

## 1. Core Framework

*   **Gemini CLI Extension Framework:** Conductor is built upon the Gemini CLI extension framework, leveraging its capabilities to integrate seamlessly with the Gemini command-line interface.

## 2. Configuration and Documentation

*   **TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language):** Used for defining command configurations within the `commands/conductor/` directory.
*   **Markdown:** Utilized extensively for documentation (`README.md`, `GEMINI.md`), project guides (`product.md`, `product-guidelines.md`, `tech-stack.md`), workflow definitions (`workflow.md`), and code style guides.

## 3. Managed Project Technologies (Supported)

Conductor is designed to manage and orchestrate projects that may utilize a variety of programming languages and technologies. While not part of Conductor's own implementation, the extension provides templates and guidance for projects using:

*   Go
*   HTML/CSS
*   JavaScript
*   Python
*   TypeScript
