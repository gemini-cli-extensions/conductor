# Spec: Research and Define Initial Integration Strategy for GitHub Copilot

## 1. Overview

This track focuses on the initial research and planning required to integrate Conductor's context-driven development methodology with GitHub Copilot. The goal is to produce a clear technical specification that outlines a viable integration strategy.

## 2. Problem Statement

GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI code assistant, but like other tools, it can lack deep project-specific context. Conductor provides this context. Integrating the two would create a powerful, context-aware development experience for a wider audience of developers.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1. In Scope

*   Researching GitHub Copilot's extensibility options (APIs, plugins, etc.).
*   Identifying how Conductor's context (`product.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `plan.md`, etc.) can be passed to Copilot.
*   Defining a high-level architecture for the integration.
*   Outlining potential user workflows.
*   Identifying key technical challenges and risks.

### 3.2. Out of Scope

*   Implementation of the integration.
*   Building a distributable plugin or extension.
*   User interface design.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

*   A document is produced detailing the research findings.
*   A clear architectural diagram and workflow description is created.
*   A high-level plan for a proof-of-concept (PoC) is defined.
