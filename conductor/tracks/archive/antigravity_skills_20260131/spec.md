# Track Specification: Antigravity Skills.md Adoption (Exploration)

## Summary
Explore Antigravity's skills.md standard and determine whether Conductor should emit compatible artifacts, without breaking existing workflow-based installation. Keep VS Code Copilot integration separate and document divergence.

## Goals
- Identify Antigravity skills.md constraints and compatibility expectations.
- Prototype optional skills.md output while keeping workflow outputs intact.
- Document differences and watchpoints between Antigravity and Copilot.

## Non-Goals
- Replacing workflows as the default output until compatibility is proven.
- Coupling Antigravity behavior to VS Code Copilot behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A research summary documents the skills.md format and limitations.
- Optional skills.md output exists behind a flag or config.
- Documentation clearly states current defaults and how to enable skills.md output.
